This plugin for `Manim Community Edition <https://www.manim.community/>`_ provides an implementation of the classic Rubik's Cube.

Installation
================================
This plugin is [available on PyPi.](https://pypi.org/project/manim-rubikscube/)
Usage of this plugin assumes that Python and Manim are both correctly installed. Manim is listed as a dependency, but no version is specified. This is because the plugin will work with any version of ManimCE that does not have breaking changes to the plugin. Some releases of this plugin have been tested with certain versions of Manim. To see what versions of Manim are compatible with this plugin, [see Releases.](https://github.com/WampyCakes/manim-rubikscube/releases)

To install the RubiksCube plugin run ``pip install manim-rubikscube``

Alternatively, the Github repository can be cloned and imported to your manim scripts as normal. Currently, this option will give import errors, but these errors can be manually fixed after cloning.
